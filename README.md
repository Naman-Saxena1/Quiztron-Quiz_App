5. Create a new branch to work on! Branch from development branch.
6. Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
7. Squash your commits into a single commit with git's interactive rebase. Create a new branch if necessary.

10. Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).
